# Weather Journal Application

Web application built to practice handling API requests and responses, dealing with the data, etc.

## How it works

* The user inputs a zip code and his/her feelings at the time;
* The web application requests weather information to the Open Weather Map API for the provided zip code;
* The user interface is updated, in a journal style, with: Date, Weather information, and User's Feelings.
